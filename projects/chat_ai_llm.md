## Objective
This project is currently in progress, focusing on the research and development of an AI-based chat application utilizing Language Model (LLM) technology.

The aim is to create a chat AI capable of answering questions pertaining to specific hospital group information, drawing from both database records and uploaded knowledge sources.
Various approaches have been explored, including LLM chaining and agent-based methods, along with prompt engineering techniques. Additionally, flow design has been implemented to distinguish database-related inquiries from general knowledge inquiries. Efforts have also been made to fine-tune existing LLMs.

Continued development aims to enhance processing speed while maintaining high accuracy in responses.
